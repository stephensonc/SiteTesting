&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My interest in these fields arose primarily from my first year of high school, in which I joined my schoolâ€™s robotics team. As a part of VEX Robotics team 2442B, I was exposed to the foundational concepts that are required in order to develop a robot. For example, the way that the code interacted with sensors and therefore enabled the programmer to get immediate, tactile feedback with regard to the intended function of the robot fascinated me. Each VEX Robotics match lasts two minutes, in which the robot operates autonomously for the first 15 seconds. Robotics allowed me to experience what engineering a product with a team felt like, and as a result I knew that that sort of field was the one in which I would intend to find a career. With this team of five students, I went to the VEX Worlds competition in Kentucky 2 years in a row, and our team placed within the top 5% of all VEX Robotics teams that had competed worldwide.
