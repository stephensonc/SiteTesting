* [Live Green Screen](https://github.com/stephensonc/LiveGreenScreen)
  * The live green screen project is an attempt to make a free alternative to expensive green screening software currently in the market. It is written in Python using the opencv library in order to process images and output them to the screen in real time.
* [Discord Bot](https://github.com/stephensonc/FuzzyApplesBot)
  * I solo developed a bot in Python for a Discord server (a service for hosting chat and voip servers) that enables the user to enter commands, to which the bot responds with a corresponding action. When a Discord server owner adds the bot, the bot will monitor the chat channels for any message starting with “!” and will respond to commands such as “!hmm,” after which it will send a random gif of a thinking face out of a list of approximately 15 stored in the resources folder. This was a summer project that I started primarily because I wanted to be able to send humorous images or gifs without storing them on my machine, but I also realized that I could write it in a language that I had never interacted with before. In developing this bot, I used the Discord API in order to interface with existing resources so that the bot could effectively access all of the required Discord functions.
